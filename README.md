Schadenfreude for the Weather

The WeatherSucks is a web application built with MongoDB, Express, and Node.js by Salomon Smeke Cohen and August Andres Meyer. TWS makes you feel better about the weather where you are by showing meaningful data about how terrible the weather is somewhere else.

We are using the OpenWeather API to grab weather data, Google's Reverse Geocoding API to help us deal with this data, and D3.js to make (very pretty) visualizations of terrible weather data.

We hope you enjoy your stay.
